<h1> persona:</h1>
<br>
<P> I'm Jesse Pinkman. I live in albuquerque. I'm average to below average tech and computer user.
	<br> I lke to throw large partys and have more money then I know what to do with.
	<br> I do not drive or have a car and I'm very lazy, if its easyer then thats the way for me.
	<br> I keep odd work and sleeping hours and I'm famous for my cooking skills but I dislike making my own food.
	<br> I usually have a pre-paid phone but this week its an LG 5 with andriod OS.</P>
